Radiation Therapy Decision Support is a web project designed to help radiation therapists (and other specialists) make a radiation plan to maximize radiation dose to tumors and minimize radiation to nearby healthy organs accurately without having to use various trial plans by comparing uploaded files (MRI and contour) to numerous other cases in our database.
